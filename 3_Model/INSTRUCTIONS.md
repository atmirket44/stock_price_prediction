# Model Definition and Evaluation

## Overview

Model involves setting up an LSTM network with several layers and tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation includes making predictions with the trained model and assessing its performance using metrics like Directional Accuracy and Mean Absolute Error.

## Guidelines

Provide information on the following issues:

- **Model Selection**

- **Feature Engineering**

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**

- **Implementation**

- **Evaluation Metrics**

- **Comparative Analysis**

Follow the instructions provided in brackets in the [Jupyter/Colab notebook](model_definition_evaluation.ipynb) in this folder.

## Submission

Complete the [Jupyter/Colab notebook](model_definition_evaluation.ipynb) to conduct your model implementation and evaluation.
