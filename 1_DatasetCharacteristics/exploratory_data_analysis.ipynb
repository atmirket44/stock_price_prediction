The dataset characteristics for this stock price prediction task using LSTM can be summarized as follows:

Dataset Characteristics

Source:
Historical stock data is downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.

Time Frame:
The data spans from January 1, 2021, to January 1, 2024.

Attributes/Features:
Date: The specific trading day.
Open: The opening price of the stock on the trading day.
High: The highest price of the stock during the trading day.
Low: The lowest price of the stock during the trading day.
Close: The closing price of the stock on the trading day.
Volume: The number of shares traded during the trading day.
Technical Indicators: Derived features added to the dataset:
SMA (Simple Moving Average): Calculated over a 15-day window.
EMA (Exponential Moving Average): Calculated over a 15-day window.
RSI (Relative Strength Index): Calculated over a 14-day window.
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) Diff: The difference between the MACD line and the signal line.
Bollinger High Band: Upper band of Bollinger Bands calculated over a specific window.
Bollinger Low Band: Lower band of Bollinger Bands calculated over a specific window.

Data Preparation:
The dataset is preprocessed to include technical indicators and drop any rows with missing values.
Feature Scaling: RobustScaler is used to scale the features to handle outliers more effectively.
Training Data: Prepared by creating sliding windows of a specified size (60 days in this case), containing sequences of features used to predict the next day's closing price.

Training and Test Split:
The training dataset consists of sequences formed from the scaled historical data, used to train the LSTM model.
The test dataset consists of sequences formed similarly, used to evaluate the model's predictions.

Data Preprocessing Steps:
Download Data: Historical stock data is downloaded for the given time frame.
Add Technical Indicators: Calculate SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc., and add them as new columns to the dataset.
Handle Missing Values: Drop rows with missing values resulting from technical indicator calculations.
Feature Scaling: Apply RobustScaler to scale features to ensure they have a consistent range and reduce the impact of outliers.
Windowing: Create sequences of window_size days to use as input features for the LSTM model, with the target being the closing price of the next day.
By following these steps, the dataset is transformed into a format suitable for training the LSTM model for time series forecasting.
